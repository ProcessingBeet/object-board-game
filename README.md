While the project is functional, it currently lacks proper destructors. This leads to memory management issues.

Path to data is hardcoded, one has to change dane.txt file in order to set up a new game. Data structure is as follows:

*number of players*  
list of length *number of players* with elements:  
  *player type* *player name*  

*number of squares*  
list of squares types:  
  *square type* *description*
